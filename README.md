# The AI4EO Air Quality & Health challenge
The challenge is to downscale air quality products to a resolution that can be used on a local level. The focus is on the pollutants PM2.5 and NO2, which are amongst the most important to consider for health effects.


## Proposed Solutions




## Results
Consisting of downscaled CAMS PM2.5 products, from their original spatial resolution of 10x10 km2 to 1x1 km2 over Europe (from 40x40 km2 to 10x10 km2 outside Europe); and Sentinel-5P Level-2 NO2 products, from their original spatial resolution of 7x3.5 km2 to 1x1 km2.


## Examples
